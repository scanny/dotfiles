Reasons I care about
====================

Keeping dotfiles under version control (git)
--------------------------------------------

You never know when you might need something later. Plus, it's interesting to
see how the collection of dotfiles evolves.


Maintaining an off-site backup
------------------------------

Hard disks fail. Even SSDs. I don't want to keep this under Dropbox because it
might need to accommodate machine-local customizations.


Easy synchronization between machines
-------------------------------------

When I take my laptop out on the road, it would be nice if I could get all the
latest updates without too much trouble. I never seem to have much time to fuss
with it, always in a bit of a rush when heading out on the road.



Reasons I don't care about (yet)
================================

Rapidly installing a new machine from scratch
---------------------------------------------

I just don't do it enough to make it worth the trouble. Yet, anyway.
